0 + 0 = 0 -- integer simplest?
5 + 0 = 5
--
1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 -- no reducting needed
8/0 = error
0 ++ (-1) = -1 negative integer addition
1/3 + (-1/3) = 0
0/3 = 0
3/5 + 4/5 = 7/5 -- improper
2/8 + 2/8 = 1/2 -- reducing with same denominator
3/-5 + 3/-5 = -6/5 -- nice to have, neg always numerator
5/4 + 5/4 = 5/2 improper, same denom, reducing
1/3 + 1/2 = 5/6 diff denominators
1 + 2 + 3 = 6  -- more than two
1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 1/1 more than two fractions
1 + 1/4 = 5/4  mixed integer fraction

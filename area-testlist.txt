Add a circle to the board
Board with 1 square = area of the square
Board with 2 squares side 2 and side 3 = 13
Board with 1 squares side 5 and circle radius 4 = 75.27
Square with side 2 = 4
Square with side 3 = 9
Square with negative side = error
Area of circle
Area of rectangle
Area of triangle
A square with side 2 only half inside the board = 2
2 squares side 3 completely overlapping = 9
a circle 3 at 1,2 and a square 5 at 2, 2 (partially overlapping) = ?
